 Braces in a string are considered to be balanced if the following criteria are met:
* For every opening brace (i.e., ( , { , or [ ), there is a matching closing brace (i.e., ) , } , or ] ) of the same type (i.e., ( matches ) , { matches } , and [ matches ] ). An opening brace must appear before (to the left of) its matching closing brace. For example, ]{}[ is not balanced.
* No unmatched braces lie between some pair of matched braces. For example, ({[]}) is balanced , but {[}] and [{)] are not balanced.
